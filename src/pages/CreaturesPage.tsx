    <h2>Enemies</h2>
      <p>Enemies mark the threats the players may face in combat. An enemy doesnâ€™t follow the same injury system as players do. Instead, when an enemy hits 0 health, they are defeated. Generally, it is up to the player who deals the final hit whether a defeated enemy is left unconscious, as a corpse, or completely banished from the area. Some enemies may have abilities based on which defeat state is chosen, but most are simply defeated at that point.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>There are many types of creatures in the Underworld.</p>

      <h3>Enemy Tiers</h3>
      <p>Enemy Types: Minion, Hellspawn, Tormentor, Archfiend, Lord, Overlord</p>
      <p>Enemies should be tough. Archfiends should be a hell of a battle, Lords and Overlords should be virtually unbeatable. Probably not worth even statting out.</p>
