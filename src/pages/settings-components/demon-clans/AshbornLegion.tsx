        The <Faction>Ashborn Legion</Faction> are infernal-aligned
        demons forged in the fires of hell, their very bodies wreathed
        in ash and embers. Though roughly humanoid in shape, the winged-beastsâ€™
        flesh is blackened and cracked like scorched earth, with molten veins
        glowing just beneath the surface. Eyes burn like smoldering coals, and
        their breath carries the heat of a furnace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creatures are born from swirling hate pods and serve as relentless
        enforcers of the Ashborne Lords, leaving scorched ruins in their wake as
        they march ever onward.
