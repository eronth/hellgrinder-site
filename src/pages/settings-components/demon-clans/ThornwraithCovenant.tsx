      <p>The <Faction>Thornwraith</Faction> are a verdant-aligned clan, an anomaly 
      in the burning wastelands of hell. Unlike other infernal factions, they thrive in primal 
      unity, their forms a fusion of plant and beast. Vines coil around their limbs, bark-like skin 
      covers their bodies, and their eyes glow with a feral, greenish light. Some bear antlers or
       thorn-covered spines, while others have claws of twisted roots.</p>
      <p>They move as one, their connection to each other and the natural world evident in their
         every action, functioning more like a pack or tribe than an army. Despite
         their savage appearance, the <Faction>Thornwraith</Faction> are deeply attuned to the life forces
         around them, though their presence in hell remains a mystery. They are often seen cultivating 
         small patches of overgrown wilderness in the Underworld â€” areas somehow untouched by the 
         surrounding destructive environment.</p>
