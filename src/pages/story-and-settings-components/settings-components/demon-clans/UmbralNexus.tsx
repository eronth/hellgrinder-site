        The <Faction>Umbral Nexus</Faction> is composed of
        Voidyr-aligned demons that bear an unsettling resemblance
        to humans, save for a few grotesque distortions. They bear
        arms with extra joints, smiles that stretch unnaturally wide,
        or eyes that sprout in strange places.
      </p>
      <p>
        These creatures inspire dark rumorsâ€”some say they were once
        human, individuals who, without any infernal influence, twisted
        their own bodies and minds into a new kind of demon. Devoid of
        a life force of their own, they now hunger to drain it from
        humankind.
