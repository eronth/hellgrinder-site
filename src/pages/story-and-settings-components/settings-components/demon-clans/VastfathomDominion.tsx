      <p>
        The <Faction>Vastfathom League</Faction> are
        abyssal-aligned demons that dwell in the darkest
        depths, born from the crushing cold of Hellâ€™s oceans of
        nothingness. Their forms are elusive and alien, shifting
        like the murky water that hides them. Some have elongated,
        serpent-like bodies with translucent skin that reveals a
        network of pulsating veins, while others bear multiple
        limbs that undulate like the tentacles of deep-sea
        horrors. Their eyes glow dimly, piercing through the
        darkness, while their touch brings the icy chill of the depths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spawned from the vast, unseen trenches of hell,
        they serve the Abyssal Sovereigns, rising from the
        fathomless deep to drag their prey into the cold abyss.
