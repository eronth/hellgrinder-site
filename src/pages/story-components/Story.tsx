        <h3>Hell's Invasion</h3>
        <p>
          In the far off year of 2001, hell broke loose... literally. Gaping holes opened in the earth as demons of all clans
          poured into the world, looking for souls to harvest and lands to conquer. The world was in chaos, and the first
          24 hours of the invasion saw the deaths of millions. Governments worldwide quickly mobilized their military forces
          to combat the new threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons' natural strength were superior to the average human, and the mastery of magic created new threats, but
          the demons were not invincible. The humans had technology on their side, and the demons were not prepared for the
          might of the modern military infrastructure. Anywhere the militaries of earth met demons in warfare, demons were
          crushed. Units tasked with pushing demons back to the hells they came from were quickly trained and deployed,
          and the war on soon hell began.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/*<!-- The war on hell -->*/}
      <div>
        <h3>The War on Hell</h3>
        <p>
          When humankind began to push through the gates into hell itself, they quickly discovered that the demons were not
          the only threat. The various landscapes of hell was as dangerous and varied as the demons themselves, and the
          humans quickly found themselves fighting for their lives against the very ground they walked on. The demons had no
          such issues, and the humans' advances were quickly halted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humanity needed a new weapons and equipment, something that could turn the tide of the war. They needed something
          that could combat the demons and the hellish landscapes. They needed something that could even the odds as they
          marched deeper into the depths. They needed access to the Arcane.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/*<!-- Materials and research... -->*/}
      <div>
        <h3>Netherworld Materials</h3>
        <p>
          The materials of hell were unlike anything found on earth. Each region had a new and strange set of substances to
          study. With each advance came new materials, with new materials came new studies and discovers, and with new
          discovers came new advancement in weapons, armor, and knowledge of the Arcane.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to spur soldiers to push into the depths to secure the resources, the military began to offer rewards
          for the discovery of new material nodes and the capture of new territories. Promises of wealth, power, and
          lands to rule over were given to those who could secure the most valuable resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, seeking such materials proved difficult. Hell would warp its pathways, making it hard to repeat
          journeys to known resource nodes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Resources of Value</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The most valuable resources that were quickly discovered were:
            <ul>
              <li>Brimstone and brimsteel from the Infernal Location (TODO: FIX ME).</li>
              <li>Demonhides and apathal coral from the Shoalpocked Expanse.</li>
              <li>Nearly any large foliage from the Twisted Wilds.</li>
              <li>Inversion cores and fool's dirt from the Deepblind Caverns.</li>
              <li>Ghostrot essences, everblood pools, and ichormud from the Ghastcursed Villages.</li>
              <li>Aukageolt and it's various related minerals from the Zephyrian Spires.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      {/*<!-- Safelight discovered... -->*/}
      <div>
        <h3>Safelight Discovered</h3>
        <p>
          That was before the discovery of a new material that
          came to be known as Safelight<TM/> by the research team that first discovered it's . Safelight<TM/> seemed
          like a
          little touch of heaven in the depths of hell. Research into the material quickly determined large quantities
          warded off demons, creating a safe zone for humans to build more permanent camps and fortifications â€” proper
          bases to operate out of. Beyond that, Safelight could be used in smaller quantities to recover even some of the
          most grievous wounds, allowing squads of soldiers to act more independently and with greater courage.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/*<!-- The Safelight project... -->*/}
      <div>
        <h3>The Safelight Project</h3>
        <p>
          Once the potential of Safelight was discovered, the military, with the help of Afterworld Research Corp, quickly
          began to invest in the material. Operations were set up to secure the material, bring back samples for study, and
          to begin distribution of Safelight Shards to teh front lines. The Safelight Project was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Safelight Project, all soldiers were guaranteed at least two Safelight Shards to carry with them, along
          with a <i>mostly</i> updated list of known Safelight havens, so long as they kept securing and retrieving valuable
          resources. The project is largely considered a success, and the front lines began to push deeper into hell.
        </p>

      {/*<!-- The Hellgrinder -->*/}
      <div>
        <h3>The Hellgrinder</h3>
        <p>
          The Hellgrinder was the next invention by Afterworld Research Corp under the Safelight Project. The Hellgrinder
          was a specialized drill, imbued with tiny flecks of Safelight<TM /> that allowed it to bore through the toughest
          walls of Hell and create passageways that resisted the warping of Hell's pathways. Though slow to operate, the
          Hellgrinder was a massive success, and the military quickly began to use it to create new predictable paths
          between Safelight Havens and forward operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hellgrinder was developed in a number of sizes for a number of vehicles. Hellshapers are large boring machines,
          capable of making pathways large enough for heavy tanks and artillery to pass through.
