      <p>The <Faction>Vastfathom Dominion</Faction> are abyssal-aligned demons that dwell in the darkest depths, born from the crushing cold of Hellâ€™s oceans of nothingness. Their forms are elusive and alien, shifting like the murky water that hides them. Some have elongated, serpent-like bodies with translucent skin that reveals a network of pulsating veins, while others bear multiple limbs that undulate like the tentacles of deep-sea horrors. Their eyes glow dimly, piercing through the darkness, while their touch brings the icy chill of the depths.</p>
      <p>Spawned from the vast, unseen trenches of hell, they serve the Abyssal Sovereigns, rising from the fathomless deep to drag their prey into the cold abyss.</p>
